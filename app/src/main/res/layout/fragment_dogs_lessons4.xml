If you couldn't distract the dog and it's preparing to bite you, cover your neck with your hands. It's the most vulnerable part of the human body. The major arteries and veins run here, so don't let the dog get to your throat. Protect your face and neck at all costs. Whatever happens, don't let the dog reach vital points such as your neck and face. If this happens, you won't be able to defend yourself. Try to put something between yourself and the animal. For example, a passing mail carrier. At worst, your hand will do. Use your weight to pin the dog to the ground. Your opponent has only one weapon - its sharp jaws. Stay away from them. Protect yourself from bites, and you'll win the fight. "/>

It got scared and ran away. What should you do next? If you realize that a bite is inevitable, offer your shin or forearm. Yes, it will hurt, but you'll avoid fatal blood loss. If the dog still bites you, don't try to pull your arm or leg out. By doing so, you'll only worsen the situation and increase the area of the wound because a dog's jaws are very strong, and its teeth will sink even deeper into your body. Instead, hit the dog on the nose or in the eyes."

- Tip of the nose
- Eyes
- Nostrils
- Back of the head
- Joints of the paws
- Groin
Use the weight of your body to pin the dog to the ground with your knees or elbows. Dogs can bite, growl, and bark, but they don't know how to fight. That's why immobilizing the animal is a good idea until someone comes to your aid. The danger can significantly increase if not one but a whole pack of dogs attacks you. It seems like it's just not your day. In this case, behave the same way as with one dog, with the only difference being that you shouldn't let the pack surround you.
Try to stand with your back against a wall or fence, and don't run. Dogs will undoubtedly chase after you because at that moment, you look to them like a tennis ball that needs to be caught."

            android:text="Part 3: After the attack. Seek medical attention. What to do if you've been bitten? If a dog has bitten you, you need to treat the wound as quickly as possible. Here's what you need to do. Gently wash the wound with soap and water, then treat it with alcohol to prevent infection. It doesn't matter what kind of dog bit you, whether it's a street dog or a familiar one. You need to go to the hospital or emergency room, where they will take your blood and additional tests. After that, you'll be prescribed a course of rabies injection if you can't confirm that the dog that bit you was vaccinated. Contrary to popular belief, you won't receive 20-30 injections in the stomach. There are only 6 ones now, and they're administered in the shoulder or thigh. The statistics show that in 99% of cases, it's dogs that transmit rabies to humans. The first symptoms of the disease appear 30-50 days after the bite, so it's crucial to get a rabies vaccine within 2 weeks, especially if the animal hasn't been checked for diseases. If you don't receive timely help, the consequences will be fatal. Unfortunately, rabies cannot be cured; only preventive measures can help. The rabies virus is transmitted not only through bites but also through mucous membranes, so seek assistance as soon as possible. Even the smallest wound can become an open door for infection. Report the dog. Call the police and report the attack. Try to describe the dog and its behavior as accurately as possible. This information can save lives."
